Let me start this off by saying that I am not formally diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve had symptoms all my life, and my Dad and brother
have both been formally diagnosed and medicated for it. I was your typical presentation in girls, so my parents had a hard time
recognizing that I had it too. I have given myself a self-diagnosis.

High school was easy. I put little to no effort into my school work, finished homework while in class and made it out with all
A’s and high honors. College was a completely different story. I struggled because I never learned how to study. I found myself
completely distracted in large lecture halls, unable to focus on the task at hand. I went through bouts of depression and anxiety
over trying to maintain the same level of success that my classmates seemed to achieve with the same amount of effort.

What came from this dysfunction was that I learned how to create systems that keep me on pace with others. I call them
_self-accommodations_. For example, my dog takes allergy "drops" after each meal to help with his environmental allergies. They work
great, but the annoying part is that you need to wait about 15 minutes after he eats in order for them to work properly. Previously,
I would sit the bottle on the counter as a reminder that he hadn't yet taken them. However, I would forget about them unless I walked
into the kitchen and saw them sitting on the counter. This led me to start thinking about how I could bring this to my attention
without physical cues.

# External Cues

I think the hardest part about dealing with ADHD and habits is that internal motivation doesn't work the same as it does for
neurotypicals. I know those drops are helpful to my dog, and I know he feels better when he takes them. Those are
intrinsic/internal motivators. They _don't_ work for me, and I recognize that.

So, how do I cue the task? For this specific problem, I made a "shortcut" on my phone that creates an alarm that goes off 15 minutes
after scanning a NFC tag that is near my dogs allergy medications. When the alarm goes off, I am cued to get up and give him the drops.
I call this an **external interrupter**.

## Interrupters

An external interrupter provides an **intrusive** cue for whatever task you are trying to accomplish. Because these interruptions can be
jarring, it is good to reserve them for _time-sensitive_ tasks, so you aren't interrupting any flow states.

Something I struggle with is restarting tasks when my flow state has been interrupted. Besides folding, this might be the reason that
laundry is the bane of my existence. Because it's a long, drawn out event, setting an alarm often interrupts work tasks that require
a lot of focus, and leave my frustrated, and delayed while trying to restart the task. Interrupter don't work for me and this kind of
routine.

## Hints

An external hint provides a **visible** cue for the task you are trying to accomplish. Like external Interrupter, they provide some
form of tangible cue for you to start your next task. The difference between hints and Interrupter, is that hints aren't going to
knock you out of your current task. But they are visible enough that you will be reminded of the thing you need to do.

In the laundry example, I have a similar set-up to the interrupter. I scan a NFC tag, but instead of creating an alarm, a reminder
is created in Things 3 for 70 minutes later so that it sits on the lock screen of my phone and I don't forget that I have wet clothes
sitting in the washer. That way, the next time I am at a stopping point and I inevitably pick up my phone, the first thing I see is
the visible cue that I have to switch my laundry. Another example of a visible cue is laying out your workout clothes the night
before to remind you that you intended to exercise the next day.

## Picking a Cue

So, this begs the question. How does one pick a cue?

There are two main things I take into consideration when picking what type of cue I want to use.

1. When does this task take place?
2. Does this task need to happen at a certain time?

If the task happens throughout the work day, where interrupting tasks can be distributive to the amount of work I can get done,
then I will gravitate towards a "hint". If the task needs to happen at a certain time, then I will likely choose an interrupter.

# Do-Power

Another important factor I try to consider when creating routines and systems is the concept of "do-power". It's similar in concept
to will-power, but I find will-power to have rather negative connotations. Lack of do-power doesn't make you lazy, or mentally weak.
In fact, this is quite similar to spoon theory[^1].

Basically, everyone comes equipped with a do-power reserve. Whenever you need to do a task, you need to reach into that reserve
and it will provide the energy to complete it. The amount of do-power a task requires is highly dependent on the person.

Say I need to do laundry. For me, laundry is something that takes a lot of do-power for a couple of reasons. The first is that
it takes awhile, and second is that it's a bunch of micro-tasks together. Essentially, a mini-project. I tend to get overwhelmed by
things that have multiple steps, and avoid starting.

On the flip side, making a grocery list is something that also requires a lot of do-power. That is because it requires a ton of
decisions to be made.

## Relationship between Do-Power and Decision Fatigue

_Decision fatigue_[^2] is a psychology concept that says the more decisions someone makes in a day, the more physically, mentally,
and emotionally drained they become. Because, let's face it. Decisions use a lot of cognitive and executive functioning skills, and
people with ADHD already have a difficult time with these to begin with.
