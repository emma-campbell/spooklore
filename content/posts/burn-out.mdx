I am burnt out.

Admitably, I am happy. I am spending more time outside, I am working out consistently, I have been reading more books, and I am doing all the things that science says a functional human should do.

But here’s the kicker -- I’m bored.

Being a healthy, functional human involves routine. That bores me to death. I get _no_ dopamine for performing the things that I do daily. I am getting stuck on TikTok and other social media instead of doing the things that I need to be doing.

On top of this, I feel stifled in my work. I’ve spent a lot of time fixing shit that other people wrote, and not a lot of time creating anything new. I’ve become envious of the solo developers and entrepreneurs who don’t have a C-Suite above them determining their next move. I think it would be freeing to build what comes to mind. I have ideas, but I am not brave enough to follow through.

While I enjoy coding and puzzle solving, I don’t have the same passion for it that I see many others on the internet. I like to build things, but I am not passionate about _building things_. I am passionate about my family, friends, and dog, and ensuring that I stay the best version of myself that I can muster. Does that even make sense? Is that practical? Does that make me an unhireable developer?
