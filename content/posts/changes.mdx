Last Friday I moved out of my apartment in D.C. I have known I was moving since last March, so it shouldn't have come as a shock, but still, I find myself caught off guard by the things that I've been feeling since then.

If you know me, you know that I am an introvert. I spend a lot of my time doing things alone. And for the most part, I like it that way. I walk my dog, listen to audiobooks, read, watch TV, or write code. But the thing is, it didn't used to be this way.

Growing up, I was heavily involved in team sports. If you've read some of my monthly rewind posts, you can probably tell that I still love soccer, and carve out time to watch it (on a minimum) every weekend. This part of my life was almost _forced social interaction_. It was draining, but I loved the soccer aspect so much that it was draining in a good way. I played literally from age five, up until my sophomore year of college when I was permanently sidelined by ankle problems.

Even after hanging up my cleats, my team remained my social network. I lived off-campus with girls on the team, and I transitioned into a coaching role. **I've always leaned on my team since the beginning of time**.

Fast forward a little bit to July 2021. I've graduated, and moved to D.C., despite working a remote job. I moved along with some friends from college, trying to establish a support system upfront.

D.C. is an amazing city, despite its reputation. There is so much to do, culture, and history (good, and bad). Not to mention all the neat hiking in a drivable distance. There is something for everyone.

I was comfortable and happy in D.C. However, leaving has made me acutely aware that I have no clue how to make friends outside of soccer or forced proximity socialization (which, I guess is just how socialization works anyway).

While I am excited about Bloomington, I am nervous about making friends. I am not associated with the university,  it strikes me as somewhat of a college town. I am anxious that it will be difficult to meet anyone new on my own. In the past years in D.C., I've relied heavily on Andrea to help facilitate many social events. While that could still happen in Bloomington, I realize that I have my interests outside of those I share with her and wish I could develop relationships using those.
