I am in a constant battle with my brain to do the bare minimum. Brush my teeth? Battle. Shower? Battle. Exercise? Battle. Make lunch? Battle.

My existence as a person with ADHD isn’t inherently harder than those without. It’s just a different kind of struggle.

For instance, you sit me in front of broken code and I will debug and optimize for hours on end. I’ll forget to eat, drink, do anything other than the thing I am hyper focused on. But ask me to do the laundry within a reasonable timeframe? Not going to happen.

I think in ways many people don’t understand. I find it tiring that I can read a book, or article, or blog post of some neurotypical person telling me that I am just not working hard enough, or I don’t have enough discipline. I am tired of fighting an internal battle while also fighting the same ones that everyone fights externally.
