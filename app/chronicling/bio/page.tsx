          Hey ðŸ‘‹ It&apos;s Emma (<i>she/any</i>). You made it to the page
          that&apos;s about me. I feel weird writing this. Seems sorta conceited
          to write about yourself. Anyways, I&apos;ll give it a whirl.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m originally from Columbus, OH, and currently live in
          Washington, D.C with my partner and my dog. I had a quick pit-stop in
          Rochester, NY where I attended the University of Rochester to get my
          Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a software engineer by day, and by night I&apos;m taking on
          all of the ADHD side quests my mind can hyperfixate on. I&apos;ve
          recently been learning to sew and in the past I&apos;ve built
          mechanical keyboards, refurbished Gameboys, and learned to play the
          guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don&apos;t know my right from my left. No, seriously. I understand
          the concept, but if you tell me to go right I will go left. I&apos;ve
          seriously considered getting &ldquo;R&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo;
          tattooed on my hands because when I hold my hands in the shape of an
          L, they both look correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the Columbus Crew, and soccer in general. It consumes my
          weekends. I recently got to watch the Crew win their third cup live
          and it&apos;s one of my favorite memories. I love sports in general,
          and believe that they&apos;re a great way to teach kids how to work
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am odd and somewhat introverted. I hate small talk, and prefer to
          talk about things that matter. At social gatherings, I tend to
          befriend the dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, that&apos;s that&apos;s a pretty good overview and should
          give you a good idea about who I am as a human. If you want to get in
          touch, you{" "}
